The current state of renewable energy adoption in these countries is growing, but at a slower pace compared to developed countries. The key challenges include lack of infrastructure, limited financial resources, and lack of technical expertise. However, there are also significant opportunities such as abundant natural resources, increasing international support, and the potential for leapfrogging traditional energy infrastructure. Evidence-based conclusions suggest that while there are significant barriers to renewable energy adoption in developing countries, the potential benefits make it a worthwhile investment. Specific recommendations include increasing international financial support, investing in education and training, and creating supportive policy environments.\",\n  \"confidence_level\": \"High\",\n  \"key_points\": [\n    {\n      \"point\": \"Current state of renewable energy adoption in developing countries is growing, but at a slower pace compared to developed countries.\",\n      \"evidence\": \"According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), renewable energy capacity in developing countries grew by 152 GW in 2019, a 7.4% increase from the previous year.
