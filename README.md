Lacquer is an open-source **AI orchestration engine** inspired by GitHub Actions. Define complex agent workflows in familiar YAML, test locally, and ship anywhere with a single binary. Built for developers who prefer **terminals** over drag-and-drop.

```yaml
version: "1.0"

agents:
  code_reviewer:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4
    temperature: 0.3
    system_prompt: You are an expert code reviewer who analyses pull requests.

inputs:
  pr_number:
    type: integer
    description: Pull request number to review
    required: true

workflow:
  steps:
    - id: fetch_pr
      run: node scripts/fetch_pr.js
      with:
        pr_number: ${{ inputs.pr_number }}

    - id: analyze_changes
      agent: code_reviewer
      prompt: |
        Please analyze this pull request and help me review it:
        
        ${{ steps.fetch_pr.outputs.diff }}
        
        Please provide:

        Keep explanations clear and accessible.

  outputs:
    pr_analysis: "${{ steps.analyze_changes.output }}"

```
