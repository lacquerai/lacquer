## Orchestrate AI Agents with Code, Not Clicks

Lacquer is a blazing-fast, code-first orchestration engine for AI agent workflows. Bring **GitHub Actions-style workflows** to AI and define complex multi-agent systems in simple YAML.

Built for artisans who prefer **terminals** over drag-and-drop.

```yaml
version: "1.0"

agents:
  assistant:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4
    temperature: 0.7

inputs:
  topic:
    type: string
    description: Topic to explore
  
workflow:
  steps:
    - id: research
      agent: assistant
      prompt: "Tell me about ${{ inputs.topic }}"

    - id: summarize
      agent: assistant
      prompt: "Summarize this in 3 bullet points: ${{ steps.research.output }}"
  
  outputs:
    summary: "${{ steps.summarize.output }}"
```

```bash
$ laq run workflow.laq.yml --input topic="quantum computing"

Running research_workflow (2 steps)

‚úì Step research completed (2.1s)
‚úì Step summarize completed (1.3s)

‚úì Workflow completed successfully

Outputs:

summary: 
  ‚Ä¢ Quantum computing ...
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

Install `laq` with a single command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://lacquer.ai/install.sh | sh
```

Use the `laq init` wizard to create a new workflow using AI.

```bash

Execute it and see the magic.

```bash
laq run workflow.laq.yml
```
